# Privacy Policy for AQI Now

**Last Updated: December 30, 2025**

Excel Technologies India ("we," "us," or "our") operates the **AQI Now** mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our service to you. 

**Note: AQI Now does not require you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information like your name, phone number, or email address to use the App.**

### Types of Data Collected

#### Location Data
To provide accurate air quality data for your specific location, the App requests access to your device's location.
- **Precise Location (GPS and network-based)**: We use your precise location to calculate the "Estimated Local AQI" by interpolating data from the nearest official monitoring stations.
- **Approximate Location (network-based)**: We may use approximate location if precise location is unavailable.
- **Processing**: This location data is processed locally on your device or sent as a numerical coordinate (Latitude/Longitude) to air quality data providers (CPCB). We **do not** store a history of your real-time coordinates on our servers.

#### Local Data Storage
- **Search History**: The App saves a local history of your AQI searches on your device. This data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.
- **Data Deletion**: You can delete this history at any time through the App's settings or by clearing the App's cache/data in your device's Android settings. Since we do not store this data on servers, deleting it locally removes it permanently.

## 2. Use of Data

AQI Now uses the collected data for various purposes:
- To provide and maintain the App's functionality.
- To calculate and display hyperlocal air quality indices.
- To provide localized health advisories based on air quality levels.
- To allow you to participate in interactive features of our App when you choose to do so.

## 3. Disclosure of Data

### Service Providers
We fetch air quality data from official third-party sources:
- **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) India**: We use the official CPCB RSS feed to retrieve station-level data. This service does not receive any personal identifiers (like your name or email) from our App.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose your Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- To comply with a legal obligation.
- To protect and defend the rights or property of Excel Technologies India.
- To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the App.
- To protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

## 4. Security of Data

The security of your data is important to us.
- **Encryption**: All data transmitted between the App and our official data sources (CPCB) is encrypted during transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS).
- **Storage**: We do not store your personal information or coordinates on our servers.

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our device and servers.
